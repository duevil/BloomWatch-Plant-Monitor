# BloomWatch-Plant-Monitor

This is the source code for a small plant sensor module called BloomCube as part of a fictitious product concept named
BloomWatch, an IoT-Platform for monitoring plant health and assisting in the care of houseplants.

BloomWatch and the BloomCube were developed as part of a project work during my 4th term at the Harz University of
Applied Science.
